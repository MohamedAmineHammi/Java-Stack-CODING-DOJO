Assignment: Ninja Gold Game
''Learning Objective:
Implement forms and process user input using POST routes
Successfully redirect on POST routes
Use session to persist data between requests
Create a mini game that helps a ninja make some money! When you start the game, your ninja should have 0 gold. The ninja can go to different places to earn different amounts of gold. They can enter a farm, a cave, or a house for guaranteed gold. Your ninja can also go on a quest, where they can earn or LOSE up to 50 gold. Your job is to create a web app that allows this ninja to earn gold and to display past activities of this ninja.

You should only need 2 methods to complete this task. Hint: Use hidden inputs to differentiate the forms.




Start with 0 gold.

Have 4 separate forms making POST requests

farm - add 10 - 20 to gold

cave - add 5 - 10 gold

house - add 2 - 5 gold

quest - add or remove 0 - 50 gold

Keep a log including the timestamp for each submission.

Use only two methods

NINJA BONUS: Create a fifth place "spa" where the ninja loses 5-20 gold (10-45 minutes)

NINJA BONUS: Create a reset button (5-30 minutes)

NINJA BONUS: Send the ninja to a debtors' prison on a second rendered page if the ninja falls too far into debt (15-60 minutes)
