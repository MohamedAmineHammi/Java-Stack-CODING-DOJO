Save Travels
A friend of yours is going to Hawaii and is worried about their budget for the trip. To save them some time and worry, you've decided to build an app that they can use to help save and plan for special occasions.

''Learning Objective:
Complete a Full-Stack, Full-CRUD application

Part 1
This is a three-part assignment. For the first part, you will be creating an app to track a user's expenses, a digital pocketbook. You'll need to create a new project that will store the details for every expense and allow users to add new expenses from a form.




Part 2
The next step is to add the ability to update expenses.




Part 3
Finally, the last step to make our little pocketbook app fully ready to track our expenses is to add delete functionality for our users. When you finish this assignment, not only will your hypothetical friend be super appreciative they get to climb up to the top of a volcano without worrying about their expenses, but you will have finished a monster project. As you wrap up this assignment, take some time to celebrate completing your first full-CRUD, full-stack assignment!

Note: While it is a good idea to practice using RESTful routing by adding delete mapping, the aim of this assignment is for you to understand how to implement a delete feature, so if you find yourself stuck and need to use a POST or GET mapping for your delete, that's fine




Create an app that keeps track of the user's expenses

The expense table should display the name of the expense, the name of the vendor, and the amount paid

Below the table, create a form that allows users to add expenses

Be sure to include the description field in your form (descriptions will only be visible on the Show and Edit pages)

Allow users to edit their entries

Allow users to delete their entries

Allow users to click on an expense in order to view its details
