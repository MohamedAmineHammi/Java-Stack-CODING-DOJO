Abstract Art
''Learning Objective:
Implementation of abstract classes
In this assignment we will practice using abstract classes by creating art. We will create an abstract Art class and inherit from it to create Painting and Sculpture classes.

Create an abstract class called Art
// inside of Art.java
public abstract class Art {
    // TODO: implement Art class
}copy
The Art class should have the following member variables and an abstract method called viewArt(). The viewArt() method should be implemented in the child classes and will be used to print information about the artwork.

Member Variables	Abstract Methods
String title
String author
String description
void viewArt()
Create a class called Painting
// inside of Painting.java
public class Painting extends Art {
    // TODO: implement Painting class
} 


The painting class should inherit from Art, and it should also contain a new member variable called paintType (ex. Oil, Watercolor, Acrylic, etc.).

Create a class called Sculpture
// inside of Sculpture.java
public class Sculpture extends Art {
    // TODO: implement Sculpture class
}


The sculpture class should also inherit from Art, and it should contain a new member variable called material (ex. Marble, Bronze, Porcelain, etc.).

Inside of a class called Museum create 3 Paintings and 2 Sculptures
// inside of Museum.java
public class Museum {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // TODO: create paintings and sculptures here
    }
}


Ninja Bonus: Store paintings and sculptures in a Museum class
We have previously made Arrays and ArrayLists that contain data like String and Integer but we can actually store our own custom classes we've made as well.

ArrayList<Art> museum = new ArrayList<Art> ();


Ninja Bonus: Shuffle and print the information for each artwork in the museum

1- Create an abstract class called Art with member variables: title, author, description

2- Create an abstract method called viewArt()

3- Create a Painting class that inherits Art and has an additional member variable paintType

4- Create a Sculpture class that inherits Art and has an additional member variable material

5- Create 3 instances of Painting

6- Create 2 instances of Scupture

7- Ninja Bonus: store the paintings and sculptures inside of an ArrayList called museum

8- Ninja Bonus: use the viewArt() method of all of the artworks in the museum in a random order
